Here, I share with the community some mathematica codes that I wrote through my career, some I am very proud of, some are a shame and do not deserve even the name of code. They are provided without any warranty but you can always write to me if you need help.

GRclaculator.nb allows to compute all the component of the Einstein tensor starting from a given metric.
