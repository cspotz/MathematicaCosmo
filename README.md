# MathematicaCosmo
Here, I share with the community some mathematica codes that I wrote through my career, some I am very proud of, some are a shame and do not deserve even the name of code. They are provided without any warranty but you can always write to me if you need help.

* [`GRclaculator.nb`](https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/GRclaculator.nb) allows to compute all the component of the Einstein tensor starting from a given metric.

* [This code]( https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/april19_up(1).nb) calculates relativistic corrections to SPT and the loop integrals, therefore allowing to reproduce some results presented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05452. 

* [`SPT.nb`](https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/SPT.nb) calculates analytically the perturbation theory kernels up to 4th order (easy to generalize to more) for any given function for the seed fields (delta/theta/phi). It is quite flexible to generalize for more fields (modified gravity...)

* [`frac.nb`](https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/frac.nb) fits the supernoavae data Union 2.1 to the FLRW model and the fractal model that I wrote down. It allow to reproduce some of the results that I presented here and here.
