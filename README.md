Here, I share with the community some mathematica codes that I wrote through my career, some I am very proud of, some are a shame and do not deserve even the name of code. They are provided without any warranty but you can always write to me if you need help.

[`GRclaculator.nb`](https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/GRclaculator.nb) allows to compute all the component of the Einstein tensor starting from a given metric.

[This code]( https://github.com/cspotz/MathematicaCosmo/blob/main/april19_up(1).nb) calculates relativistic corrections to SPT and the loop integrals, therefore allowing to reproduce some results presented in (https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.05452).
